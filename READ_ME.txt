READ ME::Calculator.py

The functionality of my calculator is a little limited, in the sense that edge cases aren't taken care of and the user can put in gibberish and
the calculator won't process it. You also need to manually enter in the parenthesis for all functions such as ln, log, sin, cos, tan, arctan,
arccos, arcsin, and sqrt, otherwise it doesn't parse properly. Other than that, it should fully run in VSCode. I had the plan to make it so the user
couldn't type in the entry box, but didn't get to it. That is bound to cause the most errors.
